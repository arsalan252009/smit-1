    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Saylani Welfare International Trust was founded in 1999 and runs many
      welfare programs. SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training) launched in 2013 with
      the goal of providing free IT and vocational training to young people so
      they can access employment and freelancing opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
      The mission of SMIT is to empower youth with practical, industry-relevant
      IT skills while removing financial barriers to technical education.
    </p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>
      SMIT combines classroom instruction, hands-on labs, project work, and
      basic career guidance. Trainings are typically delivered at SMIT centers
      and may include short assessments or an entry check to place students in
      appropriate classes.
    </p>

    <h3>Who can apply?</h3>
    <p>
      SMIT typically welcomes students who have completed basic schooling
      (matric/intermediate or equivalent). Specific eligibility details and
      entry procedures vary by center and course; contact the nearly your area SMIT center
      for exact requirements.
